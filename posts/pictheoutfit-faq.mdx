* Generation of hateful, harassing, or violent content

**Why are users limited to generating 180 images per week?**

Generating images using AI is expensive, and PicTheOutfit prioritizes generating images quickly to get images generated within ~10 seconds. Allowing any more image generations would cause PicTheOutfit to lose money.
