**Privacy Policy**

Austin Cheng built the PicTheOutfit app as a commercial service. This service is provided by Austin Cheng and is intended for use as is.

This page informs visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

By choosing to use my service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at PicTheOutfit unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

To enhance your experience, I may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to name, email address, user ID, and photos. This information will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way unless it needs to be used for improving your user experience or for service-related issues.

**The Information We Collect and Share**

We collect and share certain information about you, as described in this section:

Information you provide to us: We collect the information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request customer support, or communicate with us.
Information we collect automatically: We may collect certain information automatically when you use our service, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, device and advertising identifiers, browser type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the services, the date and time of your visit, information about your activities (such as the links you click and pages you view) within the services, and other standard server-log information.
We do not sell your personal information in the conventional sense. However, like many companies, we use services provided by Google, OpenAI, and others that help deliver interest-based ads to you.

**Third-Party Services**

PicTheOutfit uses services and data processors, such as Google Firebase and OpenAI, that adhere to the highest form of security standards. These third-party companies and individuals are employed for the following reasons:

To facilitate our Service;
To provide the Service on our behalf;
To perform Service-related services; or
To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

**Security**

Your trust in providing us your Personal Information is valued, and we strive to protect it by using commercially acceptable means. These means include authentication using encrypted Google Firebase credentials and the use of the HTTPS standard. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 (under 16 for EU citizens). If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us so that necessary actions can be taken.

**Data Retention and Deletion**

We retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide the services to you and others, and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information that we physically have access to, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your account from the "Account Settings" section of the app. When you request to delete your data, all of your data will be deleted, except for data strictly necessary to store whether or not you have used up your free trial. This means that the only information kept on you after you delete your data is your Firebase UID and the usage status of your free trial, neither of which is tied to any of your personal information.

**Your Data Rights**

For users in the European Union, you have the right to access the personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us.

For California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose the categories of personal information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from where we collect personal information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which is what we have detailed above. You have the right to access and delete your personal information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at austinjcheng@gmail.com.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

This policy is effective as of 07-20-2023
