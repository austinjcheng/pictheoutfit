You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to Austin Cheng.

Austin Cheng and the end-user acknowledge that this EULA is concluded between Austin Cheng and the end-user only, and not with Apple. Austin Cheng, not Apple, is solely responsible for the PicTheOutfit app and its content. The app and its use are subject to these terms and must not conflict with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.

The license granted to the End-User for the Licensed Application is limited to a non-transferable license to use the PicTheOutfit app on any Apple-branded products that the end-user owns or controls, as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.

Austin Cheng is committed to ensuring that the PicTheOutfit is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

Austin Cheng is solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services for the PicTheOutfit app, as required under applicable law. Austin Cheng and the end-user acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the PicTheOutfit app.

Austin Cheng, not Apple, is responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. In the event of any failure of the PicTheOutfit app to conform to any applicable warranty, the end-user may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the PicTheOutfit app to that end-user.

**Subscription Services and In-App Purchases**

PicTheOutfit offers a subscription service on a weekly basis. With a subscription, users can create up to 200 outfit images per week, access advanced AI styling, and generate high-resolution 1024x1024 images without watermarks.

If a user reaches their weekly limit of 200 images, they have the option to purchase an overage credits pack. Each overage credits pack allows the user to generate an additional 150 images. These overage credits expire one calendar year after purchase, ensuring users ample time to utilize their additional image creation capacity. Please note that users can only have one active pack of overage credits at a time. Once all credits from a pack are used, or the pack expires, users can then purchase another pack if needed.

Payments for both subscriptions and overage credits packs are processed directly via your Apple ID account upon confirmation of the purchase. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the current subscription period ends. The renewal fee will be charged to your account within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

Please note that overage credits packs are not automatically renewed and need to be purchased manually each time.

You can manage your subscriptions and cancel them via your account settings on the App Store post-purchase.

**Data Collection and Privacy**

To facilitate the provision of our services, PicTheOutfit requires users to sign in with Apple. Through this process, we collect your name and email to establish your PicTheOutfit account. We strictly limit the use of this information to app functionality, and do not share it with any third parties.

Furthermore, our app communicates user-provided images and prompts to our backend. We utilize this data solely to provide the service and enhance the performance of our app.

For a comprehensive understanding of our data handling practices, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

**Account Deletion**

Users retain the right to delete their accounts at their discretion at any point in time via the app's settings. Upon the deletion of an account, we ensure that all associated data, including images and prompts, are permanently erased from our servers. However, for the purpose of ensuring fair use of free trials, we will retain the user's Firebase UID and the usage status of their free trial. This limited data retention is strictly for the functionality of the app and will not be used for any other purpose.

**User Rights Under GDPR and CCPA**

Users residing in certain countries, including the EU and California, are afforded certain rights regarding their personal information. Except where an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal information. For EU residents, you also have the right to object to us processing your personal information or to restrict us from processing this information.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at austinjcheng@gmail.com.
